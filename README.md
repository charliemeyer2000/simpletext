## what is simpletext?

simpletext is a **stupidly simple** sms service developed to remove barriers to entry to use sms and otp services. unlike other messaging services, we make it so simple to start sending sms, removing bloat, credit card requirements, and other unnecessary hurdles imposed by other sms providers.

### üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Design Decisions & Credits

This website was majorly inspired by [uploadthing](https://uploadthing.com). Just as they improve developer experience interacting with S3 for modern devs, simpletext strives to improve developer experince with sms, while also lowering barriers to entry. I also took inspriation from both [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) and uploadthing when designing the UI.

Major technical design decisions:
- Infra as code allows me to easily deploy my stacks across region and environment, easily improving simpletext's durability. 
- NextJS and Vercel allowed for quick testing and deployment without major hurdles.
- I separated and compartmentalized data into separate DynamoDB tables with GSI's to support complex queries and utlimately improve end-user response time. 
- Because I am providing a costly service for free, my infrastructure needed to be protected. To do this, I protected my APIGW with a WAF and Shielf. This provides advanced DDoS, XSS, CSRF, and SQLi protection, among other OWASP Top 10 threats. 

### üìà Future Goals
