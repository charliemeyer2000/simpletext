# React & Next.js (JavaScript Frameworks)

For any framework that uses JavaScript, you can use the `@simpletext/client` package to interact with the simpletext API!

<EnvSetup />

## Set Up Your Client

<Steps>
### Create a Config File

Similar to Firebase and other services, we suggest that you create a central configuration file
for your simpletext client to use throughout your app. You can re-use this file in any component or API route, 
rather than re-declaring the `SimpleTextClient` each time.

```ts filename="lib/simpletext.ts"
import {SimpleTextClient, SimpleTextConfig} from "@simpletext/client";

const config: SimpleTextConfig = {
  secretKey: process.env.SIMPLETEXT_SECRET!,
  appId: process.env.SIMPLETEXT_APP_ID!,
};

export const simpletext = new SimpleTextClient(config);
```

### Use The Client

Now that you have your client set up, you can use it to interact with the simpletext API. Below is a simple example
using it in NextJS 14 with the `/app` router. 

```ts filename="app/page.tsx"
"use client";
import {simpletext} from "@/lib/simpletext"; // or wherever you put your client!
import {SendSMSParams} from "@simpletext/client";

export default function Page() {

    const sendSMS = async (params: SendSMSParams) => {
        try {
            const response = await simpletext.sendSMS(params);
            console.log(response);
        } catch (error) {
            console.error(error);
        }
    }

    return (
        <button onClick={() => sendSMS({to: "+11234567890", message: "Hello, Ryland!"})}>
            Send SMS
        </button>
    )
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  Although we're using NextJS in this example, you can use the `simpletext` client in any JavaScript framework!
</Callout>

### Use it in Next API Routes!

If you're working on the bleeding edge with Next.JS and the app router, you can also call your client from an API route.

```ts filename="pages/api/sms/route.ts"
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
import {simpletext} from "@/lib/simpletext"; // or wherever you put your client!

export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {

    const {to, message} = await req.body.json();

    try {
        const response = await simpletext.sendSMS({to, message});
        return NextResponse.json({message: "SMS Sent!"}, {status: 200});
    } catch (error) {
        return NextResponse.error({message: "Failed to send SMS"}, {status: 500});
    }
}
```

</Steps>
