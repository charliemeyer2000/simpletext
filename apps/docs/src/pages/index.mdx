# What is simpletext?

simpletext is a stupidly simple service to handle SMS messages and OTP verification. 
And it's free - no credit card to sign up, and you get 100 messages for free every day.

simpletext removes the bloat and barriers to entry necessary to send sms messages, perfect
for a simple project or a quick hackathon, but scalable to handle production traffic. To achieve this, we did three main things:

## 1. Simplified API and User Experience

We timed outselves speedruninng setup for simpletext - _we got an sms message [sent in under 1 minute in a 
NextJS application](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY5Nvw57mQs)_ and _sent in 23 seconds with cURL_. Point being, it's __fast__ and __easy__ to get started.
When developing simpletext, we foucsed heavily on the developer experience, making a bloatless
UI to just get started - emails, credit card, spam or promotions. We just give talented developers
the tools to built awesome things.

In doing this, we've made the API as simple as possible, boiling down the process to three api calls - 
`sendSMS()`, `requestOTP()`, and `verifyOTP()`. That's _it_.

## 2. Type-Safe Package for the Client

We've also created a type-safe package to interact with the simpletext API, `@simpletext/client`, but users 
may also interact with the API directly through cURL, HTTP clients, or other languages' built-in request modules. This way, 
we let developers be developers and use our tools the _way they want_. 

## 3. Open-Sourced Libraries 

We've open-sourced our `@simpletext/client` package to allow contributions and improvements from the community,
and we further welcome contributions to the [docs](https://github.com/charliemeyer2000/simpletext/tree/main/apps/docs) 
and [examples](https://github.com/charliemeyer2000/simpletext/tree/main/examples).
