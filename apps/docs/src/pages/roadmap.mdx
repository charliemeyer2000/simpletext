# SimpleText Roadmap

We're constantly working to improve SimpleText and add new features. Here's our current roadmap for upcoming developments.

## Next Up

<Steps>
### Additional Fraud Detection 
Add Fraud Detector to the stack to avoid spam and abuse of the service, along with automatic "kill-switches" for applications/accounts
displaying fraudulent traffic.

### Minimalist Framework Examples
Create simple examples for React.js, Next.js, and Angular.js to show how to integrate simpletext into your web app.

### Authentication Flow Examples
Create fully-fledged examples for authentication flows with simpletext's OTP service with:
- NextAuth & Next.js
- Firebase & React.js

### React Components
Develop simple React components and hooks in a package: `@simpletext/react` to provide a more seamless integration experience for React developers
who want minimal overhead. 

</Steps>

## This Year

<Steps>

### NextJS Integration
Route handlers automagically created in a `/api/[...simpletext]` folder for NextJS developers

### Advanced Developer Features
For simpletext developers on the "expert" plan with a custom phone number, provide the ability to create custom responses to users based on their input. 

### Swift Support
Add support for Swift, enabling iOS developers to easily integrate SimpleText
</Steps>

## Completed Features

1. Migration to monorepo - docs, examples, and packages are now [all in one place](https://github.com/charliemeyer2000/simpletext), allowing the
