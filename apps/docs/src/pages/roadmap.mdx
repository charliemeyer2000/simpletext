displaying fraudulent traffic.

### Authentication Flow Examples
Create fully-fledged examples for authentication flows with simpletext's OTP service with:
- NextAuth & Next.js
- Firebase & React.js

### Minimalist Framework Examples
Create simple examples for React.js, Next.js, and Angular.js to show how to integrate simpletext into your web app.
