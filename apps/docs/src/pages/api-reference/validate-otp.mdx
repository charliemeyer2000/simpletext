# Validating OTP

<Callout type="info">
  Validating OTP codes is for "simple" and "expert" plans only. If you're on the "free" plan, [upgrade](https://simpletext.dev/pricing) to access this feature.

This guide explains how to validate a One-Time Password (OTP) using the SimpleText API. Once you have requested an OTP, 
you can use the `referenceId` returned by `requestOTP` to validate the OTP code entered by the user. Recall that all phone numbers that you are requesting an OTP code for are *expected to be in E.164 format* (e.g., if your phone number is +1-123-456-7890, you would
send it as `+11234567890`).

## Code Examples

### Using the SimpleText Package

Once you have requested a one-time code with `requestOtp`, you will be returned a `RequestOtpResponse` object with a `reference_id`. 
Use the `validateOTP` method to validate an OTP code with the `reference_id`:

```typescript
import {simpletext} from "@/lib/simpletext"; // or wherever you put your client!
import {ValidateOTPParams} from "@simpletext/client";
export async function validateOTP() {
  const params: ValidateOTPParams = {
    to: "+13472764531",
    referenceId: "abc123def456", // unique id returned by a call to requestOTP
    otpCode: "123456", // code sent to the phone number in the to field
  };
  try {
    const response = await simpletext.validateOTP(params);
    console.log(response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
```

### Using cURL

You can also validate an OTP directly using cURL:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.dev.simpletext.dev/validate-otp \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "to": "+13472764531",
    "reference_id": "abc123def456",
    "otp_code": "123456",
    "SIMPLETEXT_SECRET": "your-secret-here",
    "SIMPLETEXT_APP_ID": "your-app-id-here"
}'
```

<Callout type="info">
  Replace the `to`, `reference_id`, `otp_code`, `SIMPLETEXT_SECRET`,
  and `SIMPLETEXT_APP_ID` values with your actual data.
</Callout>

### Response

Both methods will return a response in the following format:

<Tabs items={['Success', 'Error']}>
  <Tab>
    ```json
        {
          "message": "OTP verified successfully", 
          "status": true
        }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```json
        {
          "error": "OTP verification failed", 
          "status": false
        }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="warning">
  Handle both successful and failed validations in your application logic.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  The `status` field in the success response will be either "valid" or "invalid"
  depending on whether the OTP was correct.
</Callout>

## Full Walkthrough

This walkthrough will guide you through the process of requesting and validating an OTP code using cURL (as a generic demonstration). 
This demonstration will use the SimpleText package for Node.js. _Note:_ this assumes you have an account, have created an app, are in the "simple" or "expert" tier, and
have your `SIMPLETEXT_SECRET` and `SIMPLETEXT_APP_ID` values. If you are looking for an example with NextJS, ShadcnUI and a proper authentication flow,

<Steps>

### Request OTP for a User

```bash 
curl -X POST https://api.dev.simpletext.dev/request-otp \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "to": "+11234567890",
    "app_name": "MyAppName",
    "SIMPLETEXT_SECRET": "sk_0d1700bb167dfd09bd31c2482fb42b5a", 
    "SIMPLETEXT_APP_ID": "9fe3e866-9dba-4c61-8b01-2b009f10edee"
}'

```

### Get & Save the Response

Once the request has been processed, you will:
1. Recieve a response with a `reference_id`. Save this value for later.
1. Recieve a text message with the OTP code.

An example response would look like:

```json
{
  "message": "OTP sent successfully", 
  "reference_id": "b2b2a7c01b18443084d9a8c9367726a9", // save this value! 
  "requests_remaining_today": 999, 
  "to": "+11234567890"
}
```

### Validate the OTP Code

Now, with the code sent to the phone number and the `reference_id`, we can validate the OTP code sent to 
the phone number (the text will look like "This is your One Time Password: _code_ from _app_name_").

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.simpletext.dev/validate-otp \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "to": "+13472764531",
    "reference_id": "b2b2a7c01b18443084d9a8c9367726a9",
    "otp_code": "446416",
    "SIMPLETEXT_SECRET": "sk_0d1700bb167dfd09bd31c2482fb42b5a",
    "SIMPLETEXT_APP_ID": "9fe3e866-9dba-4c61-8b01-2b009f10edee"
}'
```

### OTP Response

Depending on whether the user passed in the correct OTP code or not, you will receive a success or 
error response as seen below:

<Tabs items={['Success', 'Error']}>
  <Tab>
    ```json
        {
          "message": "OTP verified successfully", 
          "status": true
        }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```json
        {
          "error": "OTP verification failed", 
          "status": false
        }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Conclusion

In this example, we've shown how _you_ can provide OTP as a part of your application - whether
for adding security layers to access pages or for verifying phone numbers of your users. Once again,
