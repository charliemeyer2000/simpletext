# Requesting OTP

<Callout type="info">
  Requesting OTP codes is for "simple" and "expert" plans only. If you're on the "free" plan, [upgrade](https://simpletext.dev/pricing) to access this feature.
  _Already a subscriber? Go to your [dashboard](https://simpletext.dev/dashboard/all) to create keys for an app._
</Callout>

This guide explains how to request a One-Time Password (OTP) using the SimpleText API.
OTP codes are used to verify user phone numbers, secure accounts, and act as an extra layer of security for your app. simpletext provides
a simple API to request OTP codes for your users, so you can focus on building your app.

Recall that all phone numbers that you are requesting an OTP code for are *expected to be in E.164 format* (e.g., if your phone number is +1-123-456-7890, you would
send it as `+11234567890`).

## Using the SimpleText Package

{/* <Callout type="warning">
  If you haven't already, make sure to follow the steps to [get started](https://simpletext.dev/login) by installing
  `@simpletext/client` and [creating an account!](https://simpletext.dev/dashboard)
</Callout> */}

If you haven't already, make sure to follow the steps to [get started](https://simpletext.dev/login) by installing
  `@simpletext/client` and [creating an account!](https://simpletext.dev/dashboard) Then, use the `requestOTP` method to request an OTP:

```ts filename="app/page.tsx"
import {simpletext} from "@/lib/simpletext"; // or wherever you put your client!
import {RequestOTPParams} from "@simpletext/client";

export async function requestOTP() {
  const params: RequestOTPParams = {
    to: "+11234567890",
    appName: "MyAppName",
  };

  try {
    const response = await simpletext.requestOTP(params);
    console.log(response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
};
```

## Using cURL

You can also request an OTP directly using cURL:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.simpletext.dev/request-otp \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "to": "+11234567890",
    "app_name": "MyAppName",
    "SIMPLETEXT_SECRET": "your-secret-here",
    "SIMPLETEXT_APP_ID": "your-app-id-here"
}'
```

<Callout type="info">
  Replace the `to`, `SIMPLETEXT_SECRET`, and `SIMPLETEXT_APP_ID` values with your actual phone number, secret key, and app ID.
</Callout>

## Response

Both methods will return a response in the following format:

<Tabs items={['Success', 'Error']}>
  <Tab>
    ```json
        {
          "message": "OTP sent successfully", 
          "reference_id": "c8ed9735700e43cd8803c07468669fa4", // an example reference_id 
          "requests_remaining_today": 995, 
          "to": "+11234567890"
        }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```json
        {
          "error": "Failed to send OTP", 
        }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure to store the `reference_id`, as you'll need it to validate this OTP code later.
</Callout>

## Additional Parameters

In addition to the required parameters, you can optionally pass in the following parameters to a request to validate an OTP (the following is for a `cURL` request, but 
the types are provided optionally in `@simpletext/client`):

- `code_length` (number): The length of the OTP code from 5-8, defaults to 6
- `allowed_attempts` (number): The number of attempts allowed to validate the OTP from 1-5, defaults to 3
- `validity_period` (number): The number of minutes that the OTP code is valid for from 5-60, defaults to 20
- `langauge` (string): The language, in IETF BCP-47 format, to use when sending the message, defaults to en-US
