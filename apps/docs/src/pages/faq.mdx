### What are the purpose of simpletext apps?

Apps are core to simpletext, as they are compartmentalizable components to separate environments (dev/staging/prod) or entirely
separate applications on the same account. We **strongly** encourage all developers to leverage apps
for managing environments properly.

### What exactly constitutes a request?

A request is a single SMS message sent or OTP code requested by a user.
These contributions add to your total daily usage _across all apps_, which depends on your tier's [daily limit](https://simpletext.dev/#pricing).

### Where's dark mode? ðŸŒš

Dark mode is a premium feature for "simple" and "expert" tier users. If you're on the "free" tier, [upgrade](https://simpletext.dev/dashboard/billing) to access this feature.
